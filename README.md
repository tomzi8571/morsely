# Fun with morse code
The story behind this project...

I just started learning react in Aug 2025 with
this [udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-boot-using-intellij-build-a-real-world-project/).
While doing this course I got carried away, developing my own makeshift *React* only app. Something that existed already
for sure - somewhere out there. But I didn't even bother to look around to see what exists already, but just wanted to
try myself. Short background story: Since I was a kid, I always wanted to
learn morse code. As a preteen I started with it from one of those magazines that encourages survival skills, doing
knods ... and using morsecode with your torch. Even as a child I thought, that it would be great to learn morse code
from examples, or to morse code with friends :) I thought about it through the years, writing a program, that
would actually help me to learn morse code from lots of examples. Back in school I had a
little programmable [SHARP 1401](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_PC-1401) in school, I wrote a lot of BASIC
programs,
mostly for maths to calculate complex numbers, to the dismay of our teacher ðŸ˜‰. But I never got around to work on this
morse program. And now, 45 years later I still thought about it - isn't that something - some thoughts or ideas never  
seem to let you go. So, finally I sat down to scratch this itch while learning react ðŸ˜‚.

Within 2 days I got a working starter running. I used a lot of AI support in IntelliJ, to help me mostly with annoying
react errors and CSS
styling issues for the mobile view. I also asked it to create a json with different excercises to learn morse could. I
must say it did a
pretty amazing (scary) job with to get a starting point. I had major problems making the UI work for the mobile view,
especially to create a non-scrollable single page view that also takes the opening keyboard on the smartphone into
account.
It took me a lot of frustrating routes, trying different height properties, like 100svh instead of 100% and javascript
to calculate the viewport... but hopefully I
The UI was not good, but I was learning ðŸ˜‰ and it was mostly about the functionality, back then.
I hope I figured it out, today, as you read this right now ðŸ˜‰

## Getting Started
As of now, the project has been deployed to Netlify. You can find it here: https://morsely.netlify.app/

## Deployment to Netlify

1. Setup the project in Netflify
   Just follow the steps in Faisals lecture 552

2. Rename the project to get a better URL.

   ![netflify.png](docs/netflify.png)

3. Install netflify CLI

   There is a detailed description here:
   [Get started with Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/api-and-cli-guides/cli-guides/get-started-with-cli/)  
   But Iused this link, with that it only involved 3 steps: [Publishing your site assets with the Netlify CLI](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/12/01/publish-your-site-assets-with-the-netlify-cli/)
    
    In your project directory (I used the terminal in IntelliJ) execute

    `npm install -g netlify-cli`

    Then I just typed 

    `netlify deploy` 

     I now got a couple of questions in the CLI to link this project to the netlify project:

     After the clicking the link the browser opened, supposedlyÂ  to link the netflify project to this project.

        Logging into your Netlify account...
        Opening https://app.netlify.com/authorize?response_type=ticket&ticket=003ace...
        
        You are now logged into your Netlify account!
        
        Run netlify status for account details
        
        To see all available commands run: netlify help
        
        This folder isn't linked to a project yet
        
        To create and deploy in one go, use: netlify deploy --create-site <SITE_NAME>

    It asked my right away to select between creating a new netflify project or link to an exiting one. I 
    selected the latter

        ? What would you like to do? â‡„Â  Link this directory to an existing project
        
        Adding local .netlify folder to .gitignore file...
        
        netlify link will connect this folder to a project on Netlify

    Now I had to enter the Project Id in Netlify. You can find in the Netflify Projectdetails (see the Screenshot above)

        ? How do you want to link this folder to a project? Enter a project ID
        ? What is the project ID? 910400aa-8....
        Directory Linked
        
        Admin url: https://app.netlify.com/projects/tomzi8571-morsecode
        Project url:  https://tomzi8571-morsecode.netlify.app
        
        You can now run other `netlify` cli commands in this directory
        
        ....

    And that was it... I typed in

    `netlify deploy`

    again, it got deployed, just like that. Pretty awesome, right?!Hope that helps someone out there ðŸ˜Š
